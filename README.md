# Retina Vessel Segmentation based on Frangi vesselness filter and UNet architecture.

I propose the following pipeline in order to perform vessel segmentation :
1) A preprocessing step which consists to enhance vessels structures with a Frangi filter.
2) A UNet architecture to learn a segmentation model. 

This repo contains :
- A notebook about retina vessel enhancement with Frangi vesselness filter. 
- Python files to train a UNet network for performing segmentation.
